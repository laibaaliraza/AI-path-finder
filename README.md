->AI Path Finding Project Using Search Algorithms
This project is about solving a search problem using artificial inteligence techniques.
The program shows how an agent find a path from a start point to a goal point on a grid.
The grid is shown visually using python and matplotlib so that we can see how the algorithm work step by step.
The enviroment also has dynamic obstacles which appear randomly and make the problem more realistic.

->What this project does?
It creates a grid
It place a start and a goal position
It apply different search algorithms
It shows how nodes are visited
It finally show the path from start to goal if found

->Search algorithms used in this project
Breadth First Search
Depth First Search
Uniform Cost Search
Depth Limited Search
Iterative Deepening Depth First Search
Bidirectional Search

->Grid explanation
The grid is a two dimensional array
Each cell has a number that represent its state
0 means empty cell
2 means start node
3 means goal node
5 means visited node
6 means final path
7 means obstacle

->Dynamic obstacles:
During execution obstacles are added randomly
These obstacles block the path and force the algorithm to find another way
This simulate a real world changing enviroment

->How to run the program?
First install required libraries
command to install:  (pip install numpy matplotlib)
Then save the code in a python file
Run the file
command to run the file: (python filename.py)
A grid window will open
A menu will appear in terminal
Select the algorithm by entering its number as given in menu
The algorithm will start working and the search process will be shown visually step by step 

->Menu options in program
1 for BFS
2 for DFS
3 for UCS
4 for DLS
5 for IDDFS
6 for Bidirectional Search

->What we learn from this project
How to visualize working
How search problems are defined
How different algorithms works
Why some algorithms are faster
Why some algorithms give shortest path
How obstacles effect searching

->Conclusion
This project help in understanding basic AI search algorithms
Visualization make it easy to see how each algorithm work
It is useful for learning artificial inteligence concepts at beginner level
